# php-seedwork project

This repository is the **php-seedwork** package: DDD and Hexagonal (Clean) Architecture building blocks for PHP (aggregates, entities, value objects, command/query handlers, event bus, etc.). Goal: scalable, maintainable software based on DDD and Clean Architecture.

- **Domain layer stays pure** — no framework or infrastructure in domain.
- **Source of truth:** [README](../../README.md) and [docs/](../../docs/) for the full picture.
